# Overview

I have created an arcade game using Python Arcade and Tiled, a tile map creator/editor

I had previously created an arcade game in Python Arcade, but I wanted to work a little more in depth, and experiment
a little more with level creation using an external source.

#Player Controls
Walk left: LEFT
Walk right: RIGHT
Jump: A
Up/Down ladder: UP/DOWN

# Development Environment
I used Tiled for creating/editing the level layout,
Visual Studio Code for the text editor, 
and the internet for sprites and level design.

Programming languages used: Python
Libraries used: arcade

# Future Work
* More levels added
* Use of keys or switches to open doors
* Longer level lengths to increase difficulty and playtime
